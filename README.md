# GymProgress Pro 🏋️‍♂️

A backend console application built with Java to help users track their gym workouts, calculate total lifted volume, and persist workout history locally.

* **Object-Oriented Design:** Structured using OOP principles with `Workout` and `WorkoutSet` models.

## Technologies Used
* Java (JDK)
* File I/O
* Git & GitHub

## How to Run

2. Compile and run the `Main.java` file in the `src/pack1` directory.
